# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

This Work Day Scheduler challenged me to put my localStorage and DOM manipulation knowledge to the test, creating dynamic HTML elements that change throughout the day according to time provided by the DayJS API. The project allows users to plan their workday in a simple and color coordinated webpage.
